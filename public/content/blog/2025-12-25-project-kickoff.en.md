# Project Kickoff: Building a Lake Mapping USV

Welcome to the DIY Lake USV Mapping project! This blog will document our journey to create an open-source solution for mapping lake depths using consumer fishfinder equipment.

## The Vision

The goal is simple: create detailed bathymetric (depth) maps of inland lakes using equipment that most anglers already own or can easily acquire. The key insight is that modern fishfinders already output standardized NMEA data - we just need to capture and process it.

## Core Principles

1. **Reusability**: The fishfinder stays unmodified. Mount it on the USV for mapping, unmount it for regular fishing.

2. **Standard Protocols**: NMEA 0183 is our friend. It's vendor-agnostic and well-documented.

3. **Open Documentation**: Everything from hardware builds to data processing will be documented here.

## What's Coming

In future posts, we'll cover:

- Hull selection and modification
- Mounting system design
- NMEA data logging setup
- GPS integration
- Data processing and map generation

Stay tuned for updates!
