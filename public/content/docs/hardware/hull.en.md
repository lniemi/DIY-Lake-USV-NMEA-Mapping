# Hull Selection

Choosing the right hull is one of the most important decisions for your USV project. The hull determines stability, payload capacity, and how your vessel handles in different conditions.

## Requirements

For lake mapping, your hull needs to:
- Be stable enough to carry the fishfinder and electronics
- Handle light chop and wind
- Be easy to transport to different lakes
- Support your propulsion system

## Options

### Option 1: Modified Kayak
**Pros:**
- Excellent stability
- High payload capacity
- Readily available
- Easy to modify

**Cons:**
- Heavy
- Takes up storage space
- May be overkill for smaller lakes

### Option 2: Large RC Boat Hull
**Pros:**
- Purpose-built for unmanned operation
- Lightweight
- Easy to transport

**Cons:**
- Limited payload capacity
- May struggle in wind/waves
- Can be expensive

### Option 3: Custom Build
**Pros:**
- Tailored to your exact needs
- Can optimize for specific conditions
- Satisfying project

**Cons:**
- Requires more skills
- Time-consuming
- May need multiple iterations

## Recommendations

For most beginners, we recommend starting with a **modified kayak** or **fishing float tube**. These provide:
- Proven stability
- Plenty of payload for batteries and electronics
- Low cost if bought used
- Easy modification for mounting systems

## Next Steps

Once you've selected your hull, move on to designing your mounting system for the fishfinder and other equipment.
