# Getting Started

Welcome to the DIY Lake USV Mapping project documentation. This guide will help you understand what you need to get started with your own lake mapping project.

## Overview

This project aims to create bathymetric (depth) maps of inland lakes using:
- An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) as the platform
- A standard consumer fishfinder for depth sensing
- NMEA 0183 protocol for data capture
- GPS for position tracking

## What You'll Need

### Hardware
- A suitable hull (kayak, RC boat, or custom build)
- Fishfinder with NMEA output capability
- GPS receiver (or fishfinder with built-in GPS)
- Propulsion system (electric trolling motor recommended)
- Battery power system
- NMEA data logger or computer

### Skills
- Basic electronics (wiring, soldering)
- Comfort with water-based projects
- Some programming knowledge for data processing

## Philosophy

The key principle of this project is **reusability**. Your fishfinder should remain unmodified so you can:
1. Mount it on the USV for mapping sessions
2. Remove it for regular fishing trips
3. Use quick-release mounts for easy swapping

This approach maximizes the value of your existing equipment and minimizes the investment needed.

## Next Steps

1. Read through the [Hardware](/en/docs/hardware/hull) section to plan your build
2. Understand the [NMEA Protocol](/en/docs/software/nmea) for data capture
3. Follow the blog for build updates and tips
